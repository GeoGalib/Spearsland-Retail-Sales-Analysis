Spearsland Retail Sales Analysis

Project Overview

This project analyzes two years of sales data (from 01-01-2022 to 10-01-2024) for the retail store Spearsland. The dataset contains information on sales revenue, marketing spend, discount percentages, product categories, and store locations across multiple regions. The goal of this analysis is to uncover key insights to help the store make data-driven decisions regarding sales strategies, marketing, and promotions.

Key Findings

•	Total Sales Revenue: 82.49 Million USD

•	Total Marketing Spend: 1.50 Million USD

•	Peak Sales Days: Saturdays and Sundays showed the highest average sales.

•	Marketing Spend Inefficiency: No correlation was found between marketing spend and sales revenue, indicating potential inefficiency in the marketing strategy.

•	Discounts vs. Sales Revenue: A negative correlation was observed between discount percentages and sales revenue. This suggests that reducing discounts could potentially increase sales revenue.

•	Holiday Sales: As expected, sales spiked during holidays, a common trend in the retail industry.

•	Top-Selling Products: Electronics were the most sold product category across all regions.

•	Top Sales Region: Congo was the highest-performing region, with peak sales on Saturdays and Wednesdays, unlike the typical weekend peak seen in other regions.

Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following columns:

	•	Store ID: Identifier for the store
	•	Product ID: Identifier for the product
	•	Date: Date of the sales transaction
	•	Units Sold: Number of units sold
	•	Sales Revenue (USD): Revenue generated in USD
	•	Discount Percentage: Discount applied to the sales
	•	Marketing Spend (USD): Marketing spend on that day
	•	Store Location: The geographical location of the store
	•	Product Category: Category of the product sold
	•	Day of the Week: Day of the week for the transaction
	•	Holiday Effect: Whether the transaction occurred during a holiday (True/False)

Tools and Technologies Used

	•	Python: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
	•	Pandas: For data manipulation and aggregation.
	•	Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization to better understand trends and patterns.

Insights and Recommendations

The analysis suggests that Spearsland could:

1.	Re-evaluate its marketing strategies since the current spend does not correlate with sales growth.
2.	Consider reducing or eliminating discounts, as lower discount percentages were associated with higher sales revenue.
3.	Focus on electronics, which are the best-selling product category, and tailor regional sales strategies, especially in Congo, where sales trends differ from other locations.

Future Work

Additional analysis could be performed with more data or more features such as customer demographics, purchase history, or competitive pricing. A more granular analysis of marketing strategies could also provide insights into why the current marketing spend is ineffective.
